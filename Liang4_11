// Scentence: Ask users to enter an number between 0 and 15 to have it converted into hex number.
/* Outline:
	1. Read through problem prompt.
	2. Watched program be built and manipulated in Comp Sci 1 Class.
	3. Then rebuilt on my own in Eclipse IDE, using the videos and notes from class.
	4. Run code to confirm it works.
	5. Make adjustments if needed.
	6. Show outputs.*/
// Discussion: I believe this solution is correct because it produces the corresponding hex number for integers 0 through 15, and it matches up with what we learned in class. 

// Code:		
import java.util.*;
public class Problem4_11 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

		// Prompt the user to enter an integer between 0 and 15
		System.out.print("Enter a decimal value (0 to 15): ");
		int decimal = input.nextInt();

		// Display its corresponding hex number
		if (decimal >= 0 && decimal <= 9)
			System.out.println("The hex value is " + decimal);
		else if (decimal >= 10 && decimal <= 15)
			System.out.println("The hex value is " + (char)(decimal + 'A' - 10));
		else
			System.out.println(decimal + " is an invalid input");
		input.close();
	}
}
