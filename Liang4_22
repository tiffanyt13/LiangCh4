// Scentence: Ask user to enter two strings of characters, and have the program report if the second string is a substring of the first.
/* Outline:
	1. Read through problem prompt.
	2. Research using Java book and internet for different ways to compare two strings.
	3. The program using chosen method. I chose printf() method.
	4. Run code to confirm it works.
	5. Make adjustments if needed.
	6. Show outputs.*/
// Discussion: I believe this code is correct because it when the user puts in two strings, the program notifies the user that String 2 is or is not a substring of String 1. 

// Code:		
//Here is a sample run: Enter string s1: ABCD; Enter string s2: BC; BC is a substring of ABCD

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Problem4_22 {
	public static void main (String[] args) {

		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

		System.out.print("Enter string s1: ");
		String s1 = input.nextLine();

		System.out.print("Enter string s2:  ");
		String s2 = input.nextLine();

		if (s1.indexOf(s2) != -1) {
			System.out.printf("%s is a substring of %s%n" , s2, s1); }

		else { System.out.printf("%s is not a substring of %s%n" , s2, s1);

		input.close();
		}

	}
